# Managed Codex visible-main transitions and recovery

This document separates the upstream App Server protocol from Hearting's local
delivery projection and from observations that have not been reproduced.

## Evidence boundary

The official [OpenAI App Server contract](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server)
provides `thread/start`,
`thread/resume`, and `thread/fork`. Successful calls return a thread; a fork can
report its predecessor, and session metadata identifies the conversation tree.
Calls can fail. The protocol does not define Hearting's visible terminal pane,
completion owner, TUI epoch, or batch fence.

Hearting therefore changes the visible-main binding only after the sole TUI's
exact request ID receives a successful response in the same gateway epoch. The
latest requested transition wins. Present contradictory `sessionId` or
`forkedFromId` values reject the transition; optional absent values are recorded
as unavailable rather than invented. Every completion carries the exact thread,
epoch, binding generation, parent session, canonical jobs registry, attempts,
and sealed batch. Missing or stale epoch/generation evidence is rejected before
an upstream `turn/start` or `turn/steer`.

| Observation | Binding effect |
|---|---|
| first successful TUI start/resume | establishes the binding |
| later successful TUI start | selects the new root conversation |
| later successful TUI resume | selects the requested conversation |
| direct TUI fork of the current binding | advances to the fork |
| failed transition or stale older response | none |
| bare notification, sibling, tool, or native-subagent thread | diagnostic only |
| another TUI epoch | none; the old evidence is stale |

The UI action that triggered the original incident has not been reproduced, so
do not label it as start, resume, or fork without captured request/response
evidence.

## Read-only Herdr check

The current Codex projection has one checked terminal-host adapter: Herdr. The
check validates the owner-private Herdr socket and proves the source pane's live
workspace, tab, and cwd. It creates nothing:

```sh
preflight.sh interactive-main-recovery --check \
  --pane "$HERDR_PANE_ID" \
  --socket "$HERDR_SOCKET_PATH" \
  --workspace /absolute/project/path
```

`--start` is a separate explicit mutation. It repeats the source proof, verifies
the protected managed launcher from its owner-private install record, asks Herdr
to create a focused visible pane in the same workspace/tab and cwd, verifies the
created pane, and starts Codex there. It never falls back to tmux. If validation
or agent start fails after the split, the result includes `created_pane`; cleanup
remains an operator decision.

Do not use this path for registered headless workers. Do not edit credentials,
sessions, logs, cache, database files, `config.toml`, trust state, or the
canonical jobs registry to recover an interactive main.

## Release boundary

A running managed session stays pinned to the release that created its gateway.
Source changes do not hot-upgrade it. Build and install one collision-free
release through the normal package path, align Claude/Codex/OpenCode projections,
then open a new managed Codex session for end-to-end verification. Existing
sessions may finish on their pinned release.
