"""The launch receipt states the parent's next action (one model-visible contract).

Completion delivery has several runtime realizations -- an interactive Claude
parent's `asyncRewake` carrier, a managed Codex single-ingress gateway, a
registered owner's session supervisor, the legacy Codex Stop hook, and the
disclosed `poll-fallback`. Which one applies is a *runtime* selection made from
the parent runtime (`resolve_parent_completion_delivery` in each adapter
wrapper), and the parent reading the receipt cannot change it.

So the parent does not need to carry that taxonomy in its own instructions. The
receipt answers the only question the parent actually has -- "what do I do
now?" -- with two typed values:

    parent_next=end-turn        a runtime carrier owns this attempt; yield.
    parent_next=bounded-wait    no carrier owns it; run `parent_next_command`.

`parent_next_reason` names which realization decided it (diagnostics, not a
branch the parent takes), and `parent_next_command` carries the exact command
for the `bounded-wait` case only -- an `end-turn` receipt deliberately hands the
parent no wait command, because a model-owned wait there is exactly what the
carrier contract forbids.

Fail-closed rule: an unrecognized delivery value yields `bounded-wait`, never
`end-turn`. Ending the turn on an unproven carrier loses the completion; a
bounded wait only costs time.
