"""Runtime closure of routes nobody works on any more.

A compiled route is a lease the runtime holds for the session that composed
it, not homework that session must remember.  `compose` and `campaign-status`
run one bounded background sweep that closes an open route only when time says
nobody works on it:

* session-ended -- this host holds positive evidence that the composing Claude
  session is gone (its own session record, whose process is dead) and nothing
  wrote to the route or its cycle for `QUIET_SECONDS`;
* idle -- otherwise (no such evidence, or Codex/OpenCode, which expose none),
  nothing wrote to the route, its cycle, its composer's route-chain ledger or
  a bound resource run's log for `IDLE_SECONDS`.  An activity scan that hits
  its size limit counts as activity.

`campaign-close` is an explicit end: besides that sweep it closes the
campaign's own open member routes that are the closing session's, or quiet
for `QUIET_SECONDS` with no provably live session.

Never closed, whatever the time or trigger: a route of the session running
the sweep (outside `campaign-close`), a route a dispatch attempt still holds
(live, unverifiable or lease-held), one whose owner's runtime settlement the
runtime itself still classifies as pending, one whose workflow ledger waits on
a human gate, one a resource run without an end record is bound to or logs
into (on any host), one with an unfinished `finish`, and one whose cycle
directory a live process holds open.  When any of that evidence cannot be
read, the sweep closes nothing.

The closure claims no proof.  Every route closes the same way,
`close_route(allow_unproven=True)` with an `autoclose` record, so its terminal
proof is exactly what completion markers already show.  Its open cycle is then
sealed with the existing states: completed when that proof holds, abandoned
otherwise.  Both steps are idempotent, so the next sweep finishes whatever an
interrupted one left: a cycle behind a runtime-written closure is sealed at
once, any other closed-but-unsealed cycle after `QUIET_SECONDS`.  A session
that comes back to an automatically closed route is not refused: `finish`
reports it closed and succeeds, `start` hands back a compose command.
A cycle inside a closed lineage that other cycles began in seals on its own
stretch of the lineage; an abandoned seal leaves symbolic links out of the
manifest and records them.  A workflow-group member that ended with no durable
output is withdrawn from its campaign's declaration in the same sweep.

The sweep writes under the artifact root only and reads the checkout with
`git rev-parse` alone.  It takes no lock it would wait for and spends at most
`BUDGET_SECONDS`; whatever it did not reach waits for the next one.
