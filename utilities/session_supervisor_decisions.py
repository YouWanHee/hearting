"""The supervisor decisions both session supervisors share.

`claude-session-supervisor.py` (Claude and OpenCode owners) and
`codex-app-server-supervisor.py` drive their runtimes' turns differently --
that part is translation and stays in each. What they decide about a
continuation (admit it against the budget, grant the one reserved terminal
hand-off turn) and about a joined child (advance its route stage) was kept
as hand-synchronized copies, "mirrored from" one another in their docstrings
(audit §4 #8, A3 row A4). Those decisions live here once.

Each supervisor passes its own `emit` so a caller that replaces the module's
`emit` (the tests) still sees every event.

    delivered-outbox intersection stay this supervisor's own predicates
    (§13.32.1-(2)7) -- the core never recomputes them, it only consumes the
    booleans this function derives.

    `delivery_timing` (this join round's own `last_child_terminal_ns` /
    `join_completed_ns`, already stamped by the ordinary SD-109 join loop) is
    reused as the canary's timing basis (block 6, checklist 6.1) -- an
    advanced outcome stamps `next_stage_start_ns` fresh and leaves
    `same_thread_resume_ns`/`exact_harvest_ns` explicitly `null` (no model
    turn occurred). A refusal never carries timing; it has no "next stage".

    Off by default (`--enable-stage-advance`): with the flag unset this
    function is a no-op and the existing delivery path is byte-identical, the
    same construction block 3 already proved for the receipt itself. A
    refusal -- of ANY kind, including an unexpected exception from the real
    services boundary -- never propagates; it is exactly as inert as not
    having called this function at all, because every refusal reason already
    means "perform today's unchanged delivery" (§13.32.1-(4)).

    §13.32.1-(2)6/(3)B: `receipt_schema_negotiated=3` and "the model-facing
    delivery actually carries the `stage_advance` v3 block" are ONE
    negotiation decision, not two independently-toggled ones -- an advance
    the model is never told about is exactly the state (3)B forbids. This
    function's own `--enable-stage-advance` gate (above) is the only thing
    that lets `receipt_schema_negotiated` become anything other than 2, and
    `receipt_with_stage_advance` no longer takes an independent `negotiated`
    flag at all -- it derives the same fact from whether the returned record
    itself carries `outcome == "advanced"`, which is unreachable unless this
    gate already fired. The durable
    `stage_advance_record_v1` for the first `outcome == "advanced"` boundary
    this round is returned so the caller can do exactly that; `None` when
    nothing advanced (including when the flag is off, in which case this
    function is the byte-identical no-op described above).
