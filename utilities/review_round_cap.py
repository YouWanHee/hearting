"""Tier-derived review-round cap leaf (CONVENTIONS §1.1 retry budget).

Moved out of `dispatch-node.py` so `capability-route.py` (SD-116 WP4) can
reuse the same derivation for its sealed `continuation_budget.review_round_cap`
without creating an import cycle: `dispatch-node.py` already loads
`capability-route.py`, so `capability-route.py` importing `dispatch-node.py`
back would cycle. Both now import this leaf instead (route_identity.py /
dispatch_launch_tuple.py precedent -- one definition, no duplication).

SD-153 adds the one shared admission decision (`round_budget`/`RoundBudget`)
that every registered launch surface (dispatch-node, dispatch-batch,
stage-dispatch-fallback) and `capability-route.py`'s owner-closure eligibility
now delegate to, instead of each keeping its own `len(prior)+1 > max_round`
comparison. A round with no verdict (a crashed/capacity-dead attempt, not a
PASS/FAIL/blocking review) does not spend the exhaustion budget by itself --
two of them in a row bind the node to the unregistered fallback chain instead
(`VERDICTLESS_BOUND`), which is a distinct outcome from "the correction budget
ran out on real verdicts"."""
