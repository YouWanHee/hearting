"""Which harness state a dispatched launch writes, decided once for every harness.

Besides its own scope, a registered attempt writes harness state: progress
files, the read-guard markers its portable hooks record, the spec-read marker,
and -- when it closes its own registry row -- the dispatch state root. A
committing linked-worktree run also writes Git metadata (`commit_policy`).

Whether a launch needs each of these is a rule about the launch, not about a
harness. It lived in the Codex wrapper because Codex is the adapter whose OS
sandbox must open these directories (audit §4 #8, A7). An adapter whose
declared access enforcement confines writes (`harness_capabilities` `access`)
projects the answer into its sandbox; one that does not confine a worker's
shell writes has nothing to open.
