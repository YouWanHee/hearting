"""SD-119 R4 — route-leg-independent admission gate for a sealed sub-session batch.

`utilities/dispatch-batch.py:340-348` (`parallel_nodes`) requires `parallel_group`
membership with 2..4 realized route-leg nodes, which the sole subdivision-permitted
node (`autopilot-code` `execute`) structurally never has (SD-119 (1)). This module
gives that node a second, dedicated admission surface that does not require leg
membership, while reusing the SD-89 full-N atomic governor reservation primitive
(`reserve_batch`) so a shortfall still yields row 0 / model 0 across the whole
batch (M-5). Admission and completion are separate gates (SD-119 (6)): this module
proves permission, reservation, fixed-file fence, and worktree baseline before any
child row or model process exists; it does not own the completion marker.
