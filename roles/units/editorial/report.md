# Unit: editorial/report

Assemble already-verified artifacts into one final user-facing report. This unit is the
assembly stage at the end of a pipeline (code report, design handoff, lab eval
report, draft finalize) — it writes for the reader, it does not judge.

## Contract

- **Inputs are authoritative.** Compose only from the named input artifacts (plans,
  checklists, dev/test logs, review memos, eval tables, figures). Invent nothing beyond
  them; every substantive claim in the report must trace to an input artifact, cited by
  path.
- **No new QA.** Verification happened upstream. Do not re-review, re-test, or add
  findings. If an input is missing, contradictory, or unreadable, return `blocked` with
  the exact gap instead of papering over it.
- **Status is a read projection.** Report assembly does not judge scientific success or
  operational completion. When a consumer needs current status, display the existing
  verification verdict, completion state, and required-input observation as separate
  values from the shared read-only projection. Preserve the report and review bytes;
  never rewrite a pending body, refine it, or request another verification round just
  to make the display agree.
- **Voice and language** follow `_voice.md` (audience-language first, rhythm rules,
  return discipline). Structure the report for the reading audience: outcome first,
  evidence next, remaining risk last.
- **Remaining risk is part of the report.** Carry forward unresolved warnings, skipped
  checks, and open decision points from the inputs verbatim-faithfully; a clean-looking
  summary that drops a known risk is a contract violation.
- **Format follows precedent.** When the runtime supplies a format exemplar or saved preferences, match their section
  order, layout, tone, and visualization style; content still comes only from the inputs. If they disagree, content follows the
  inputs and format follows the conventions.
- Write the report to the assigned artifact path (node-owned scope); return per
  `_shared/dual-io.md`.
