description: "Run the portable autopilot-lab capability through the OpenCode adapter. Meaning: Set up experiments, evaluate, and report results, including fixed results."
---

Use the OpenCode adapter realization of portable capability `autopilot-lab`.
This is adapter-owned output generated from `capabilities/autopilot-lab.md`, not a runtime-specific command copy.

1. Read `capabilities/autopilot-lab.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability-info autopilot-lab` and
   obey `instruction-only`, `tool-contract`, or `unsupported` status. For
   `tool-contract`, report the named `tool_contract`, run any
   `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before
   claiming full support. For `unsupported`, stop or use the reported
   `fallback`.
3. Before edits, run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`.
4. Before spec-changing work, run
   `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability autopilot-lab [cwd] [session-id]`.
5. If the command receives arguments, map them to the portable argument shape:
   `<task description> [--mode setup|eval|auto] [--parent <slug>] [--ref <similar-model-path>] [--intensity direct|quick|standard|strong|thorough|adversarial] [--report] [--from spec|scaffold|run|eval|summary]`.

Portable contract excerpt:

- Invocation semantics: Rapid experiment prototype entrypoint. `setup` prepares an experiment from spec through scaffold, smoke, and the full run when the execution environment and `full-run` part are included in the approval obtained at route start. Otherwise, report the run command and leave the part out for a later compose. `eval` owns experiment evaluation, synthetic failure reproduction, model comparison, and the resulting analysis and report, including interpretation of already fixed metrics without new measurements. Prose and HTML reports remain lab outputs; audio/media uses playback HTML. Reuse sufficient existing results and select only the needed stages. Extension cases use `--parent <slug>` rather than new modes: fine-tuning creates a setup config branch, and reevaluation uses eval. Enforce per-experiment folders, a STORY narrative, and an append-only `_RUNLOG` timeline with pending/completed state and parent links to prevent overwrites and ad hoc loss. Automatically read `experiment_conventions.md` and `similar_models.md` from analyze-project, giving the user's existing layer, prefix, and config patterns priority. Graduate refinement or library work to autopilot-code. Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.
